**Item 2 : Cultural Policy**<br />

A. Core Values:
Honesty, Integrity, Immersion. 

Our fundamental beliefs at AlexandriaVR act as the compass points that characterize who we are as a company and how we engage with the outside world. First and foremost, honesty demonstrates our dedication to openness and veracity in all facets of our work. We think that establishing trust is crucial, and that sincerity is the cornerstone of enduring partnerships.

The second pillar of our fundamental principles, integrity, stands for the moral and ethical foundation of our business. Both inside and beyond the company, we work hard to uphold the highest standards of conduct. Our drive to making a positive impact on the world is reflected in our commitment to honesty, which goes beyond the items we produce.

The third fundamental value, immersion, captures the essence of our purpose. Our goal is to offer the most immersive, unmatched historical VR experiences. We make sure that our products take people to various times by promoting an immersive culture, which enables them to interact with and comprehend history in a meaningful and lasting way.


B. Motivation: <br />
The ability of technology to close gaps between the past and present is something we adore. We have a strong desire to create virtual reality experiences that preserve human history, educate, and impress mankind. Our passion for history inspires us to preserve and disseminate a range of cultural narratives in order to prevent them from being lost to time.

Our apprehension is the degradation of our cultural legacy and the disappearance of events that mold our group identity. We worry about a future in which the colorful tales of the past are lost. This anxiety drives us to labor nonstop to use virtual reality technology to preserve, reproduce, and make available the multitude of human experiences that are at risk of disappearing.

**Item 4 : Experimentation & Priorities** <br />
A. Experimentation  <br />

Strategy Restatement:
Create experiments to understand the desires and expectations of our potential customers. From the results of our tests and through the process of building and testing our product, we must actively collect information about product development, market and competitor data, ethical content development, accessibility, community engagement, potential partnerships and collaborations, financial optimization, and social responsibility and sustainability. This information is necessary to understand how we can design the highest quality product without compromising any of our objectives and key results.

Prototype:
In order to create accurate experiments for product development and user experience data, we must create a working prototype or demo of our product that closely resembles our vision for the final design. Before creating the prototype, we must research the information we intend on presenting in the demo. While creating the prototype, we must take into account the appeal to potential users, double check the accuracy of the information we previously found, and record data of the creation process. After the prototype has been completed, we must release the early access version to interested users and collect data of their experiences through user reviews as well as a survey.

The process of researching historical information to be presented in the demo should be very inexpensive depending on how specific and detailed we want the experience to be. More specific information may take longer to obtain and the inclusion of more detailed information introduces more risk of inaccuracy. Hiring a team dedicated to historical research would be more expensive than dividing the research to be done among us four, but it would save a lot of time by allowing us four to focus on learning how to build a VR experience. Hiring a research team would also be necessary in the future when we need to expand and include more VR experiences that inform users about different topics.

In order to create a virtual reality experience, we will need a game engine that is inexpensive, easy to learn, and gives us full rights over the projects we create. The Godot engine seems like the best choice given the fact that it supports creating virtual reality projects, it is free, and open source under the MIT license which gives us sole copyright ownership over anything we create using the engine. In order to playtest our project, we will need a VR headset. One of the most affordable options that still provides a high quality virtual reality experience would be the Meta Quest 2. These are currently sold for about three hundred dollars.

After completing a working design of the virtual reality experience, we need to find ways to promote our product to potential customers in our target audience. Possible customers of our product include but are not limited to elementary school teachers, high school history teachers, high school students, professors, college students, history museums, history enthusiasts, historians, and virtual reality enthusiasts. Creating a presentation of our product and how it works can be a great way to get schools to understand AlexandriaVR. This presentation can be done in video form and also be posted on social media sites, and if we have the money, it can run as an advertisement on social media sites as well as websites focused on virtual reality.

People who download AlexandriaVR outside of the education industry will have a simple four-question survey they can complete after finishing the demo experience. This survey will help us understand user satisfaction as well as how sufficiently we are completing our objectives and key results.

Survey questions:

  1. (for ethical content development) Was the information presented in the experience historically and culturally accurate? If not, please explain what was incorrect.

  2. (for community engagement) On a scale of 1-5, how likely are you to join an online community centered around AlexandriaVR such as an AlexandriaVR discord server?
  
  3. (for financial sustainability) On a scale of 1-5, how likely are you to pay for this product? Would you rather pay for each individual experience, or pay a subscription to access to all experiences?

  4. (for measurable impact) Did you learn anything from this experience? If you would like to, please write 1-5 sentences explaining what you learned.

This survey as a whole covers the product development OKR. Market penetration and global accessibility can be evaluated by the interactions on our social media posts, educators interested in our product, downloads of our demo, and the general locations of where interactions and downloads are coming from. Partnerships and collaborations can be evaluated by how many software companies, virtual reality companies, school districts, and educational institutions are interested in partnering with us.

We can work directly with schools and educators interested in trying a demo of AlexandriaVR. Professors, teachers, and administrators can try the demo experience and give feedback as well as answer the questions on the survey prompted by the completion of the demo. Schools can also allow students to volunteer to test the experience. During student testing, we can analyze how they tend to interact with the virtual environment and understand how to optimize the experience to be more informative and understandable for learners.


B. Priorities:  <br />

We believe the most valuable data will be from the user testing from educators. Educators will be able to give valuable feedback regarding the effectiveness of our teaching techniques. Students testing the demo will be arguably more valuable because it can provide actual data on how users interact with the experience.
